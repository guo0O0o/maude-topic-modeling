THE AIM OF THIS RETROSPECTIVE STUDY WAS TO PRESENT THE 3-YEAR OUTCOME OF THE GOREÂ® VIABAHNÂ® ENDOPROSTHESIS FOR SUPERFICIAL FEMORAL ARTERY (SFA) OCCLUSIVE DISEASE, POPLITEAL LEVELS P1, P2 AND P3. THE PRIMARY END POINTS WERE THE 3-YEAR PRIMARY, PRIMARY ASSISTED, AND SECONDARY PATENCY RATES OF THE DEVICE. A TOTAL OF 73 SFAS IN 70 PATIENTS WERE TREATED WITH A GOREÂ® VIABAHNÂ® ENDOPROSTHESIS IN THREE CENTERS (B)(6) BETWEEN (B)(6) 2009 AND (B)(6) 2011. THE MEAN LESION LENGTH WAS 17.4 CM, AND 84% WERE CLASSIFIED TRANSATLANTIC INTER-SOCIETY CONSENSUS II TYPES C AND D. THE SFA WAS APPROACHED EITHER PERCUTANEOUSLY OR BY SURGICAL CUTDOWN. IN CASE OF A CONCOMITANT LESION IN THE COMMON OR DEEP FEMORAL ARTERY, AN ENDARTERECTOMY WAS PERFORMED. THE STENOTIC SECTION WAS PASSED WITH A TERUMO WIRE (TERUMO MEDICAL CORPORATION) AND A CATHETER, AND A DISTAL RE-ENTRY WAS MADE. THE DISEASED SEGMENT WAS DILATED, AND GOREÂ® VIABAHNÂ® ENDOPROSTHESIS WERE PLACED FROM DISTAL TO PROXIMAL WITH MINIMAL OVERSIZING. THE ENTIRE DISEASED SEGMENT WAS COVERED WITH THE DEVICE, WHICH WERE POSTDILATED WITH AN ANGIOPLASTY BALLOON OF THE SAME SIZE AS THE DEVICE. TWENTY-FOUR LESIONS (34%) WERE TREATED WITH ONE DEVICE, 23 (31%) WITH TWO DEVICES, 25 (34%) WITH THREE DEVICES, AND 1 (1%) WITH FOUR DEVICES. IN TOTAL, 149 DEVICES WERE USED, OF WHICH 9 (6%) HAD A DIAMETER OF 5 MM, 116 (78%) HAD A DIAMETER OF 6 MM, 22 (15%) HAD A DIAMETER OF 7 MM, AND 2 (1%) HAD A DIAMETER OF 8 MM. CONCOMITANT TREATMENT WAS PERFORMED IN 29 PROCEDURES (39%), CONSISTING OF ENDARTERECTOMY OF THE COMMON FEMORAL ARTERY (N = 13), ANGIOPLASTY OF THE ILIAC ARTERIES (N = 7), ANGIOPLASTY OF THE POPLITEAL ARTERY (N = 3), ENDOVASCULAR ABDOMINAL ANEURYSM REPAIRS (N = 2), SURGICAL DÃBRIDEMENT OF AN ULCER (N = 2), AND TOE AMPUTATION (N = 1); ONE SUBJECT WAS TREATED WITH THROMBOLYTIC THERAPY BECAUSE OF PREPROCEDURAL CRURAL THROMBOSIS. WITHIN THE ARTICLE IT WAS REPORTED, THAT IN FIVE CASES, EARLY OCCLUSION OCCURRED, OF WHICH FOUR WERE SUCCESSFULLY TREATED WITH THROMBOLYTIC THERAPY, AND ONE RECEIVED A SURGICAL BYPASS."

THE ACTUAL COMPOSITE SCORE WILL NOT BE PROVIDED IN THE DEVICE REPORT.\" EXACT SCIENCES REPORTS \"BOTH FALSE POSITIVES AND FALSE NEGATIVES DO OCCUR. IN A CLINICAL STUDY OF COLOGUARD, 13% OF PEOPLE WITHOUT CANCER OR PRECANCER TESTED POSITIVE (87% SPECIFICITY)\"; 13% IS A RATHER HIGH RATE OF FALSE POSITIVE. THIS IS THE RATE REPORTED, MOST LIKELY UNDERESTIMATED. HOWEVER, UPON CONTACTING EXACT SCIENCES FOR SPECIFIC DETAILS ON THE POSITIVE RESULTS, THE RESPONSE IS THAT THE REQUESTED INFO IS NOT AVAILABLE AND NOT SHARED. EXACT SCIENCES INDICATES THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO PROVIDE THIS INFO PER THE FDA AS THEIR TESTING IS QUALITATIVE. ALTHOUGH IT IS REFERENCED AS QUALITATIVE IN THE SSED, THEIR SCORING SYSTEM UTILIZED TO DETERMINE THE POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE RESULT INDICATES IT IS QUANTITATIVE. PTS AND DRS SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THE SPECIFIC RESULTS OF EACH OF THE MARKERS TESTED THAT DETERMINE THE SCORE LEADING TO THE POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE RESULT. IF THE TESTING IS BACKED BY SCIENTIFIC DATA AND QUANTIFIED AS OUTLINED ABOVE, DETAILED RESULTS SHOULD BE PROVIDED. DUE TO THE HIGH RATE OF FALSE POSITIVES, THE PT AND DR SHOULD BE PROVIDED THESE DETAILS AS A MEANS TO COLLECTIVELY DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE F/U. THE DISCLAIMER THAT ALL PTS, WHETHER RECEIVING A POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE RESULT, SHOULD PROCEED WITH A COLONOSCOPY INDICATES A LACK OF VALIDITY TO THEIR TESTING AND PROVIDED RESULTS. ADDITIONALLY, IN READING THROUGH THE SSED THERE ARE MANY QUESTIONABLE AREAS OF INFO (OR LACK OF) THAT ARE CONCERNING. PERHAPS IF THE SPECIFIC DETAILS DETERMINING THE REPORTED POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE RESULT ARE NOT WORTHY OF REPORTING, THE PURPOSE AND VALIDITY OF THE TESTING SHOULD BE EVALUATED AND CHALLENGED FURTHER. EXACT SCIENCES WAS UNABLE TO PROVIDE THE TESTING DATE. FDA SAFETY REPORT ID# (B)(4)."

THE OUTSIDE LAB RAN THE VIRAL LOAD BEFORE PERFORMING THE RESISTANCE GENOTYPE AND FOUND 125 UI/ML (QIAGEN METHOD).
