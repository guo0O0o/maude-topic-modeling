THIRTY-FOUR PATIENTS WITH INCOMPETENT SAPHENOUS VEINS (47 GSVS AND 16 SSVS) WERE TREATED AT A SINGLE SESSION, WITH THE VENASEAL CLOSURE SYSTEM. CONCOMITANT PHLEBECTOMY WAS PERFORMED IN 15 (44.1%) OF 34 PATIENTS. PATIENTS REVISITED THE CLINIC ON 10 DAYS, 1 MONTH, AND 3 MONTHS AFTER SURGERY. POSTPROCEDURAL EVALUATIONS INCLUDING NUMERICAL PAIN RATING SCORE, REVI SED VENOUS CLINICAL SEVERITY SCORES (RVCSS), AND ABERDEEN VARICOSE VEIN QUESTIONNAIRES WERE CHECKED. DUPLEX ULTRASOUND WAS PERFORMED ON 10 DAYS, 1 MONTH, AND 3 MONTHS. THERE WERE NO DEVICE-RELATED COMPLICATIONS DURING THE PROCEDURE. EIGHT PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH ERYTHEMA, ITCHING, PAIN, EDEMA, AND TENDERNESS OVER THE TREATED VEIN POST PROCEDURE. THE PATIENTS WERE TREATED WITH NSAIDS FOR 5 TO 7 DAYS. ALL PATIENTS RECOVERED FULLY IN 2 WEEKS. FOUR PATIENTS SHOWED PIGMENTATION OVER THE TREATED AREA, WHICH ALL OCCURRED AT THE EPIFASCIAL GSV AREA. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT CYANOACRYLATE CLOSURE, VENASEAL SYSTEM, IS SAFE AND EFFECTIVE FOR THE TREATMENT OF INCOMPETENT SAPHENOUS VEINS."

THE HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL (HCP) USED A CONTRALATERAL APPROACH WITH A 6 FRENCH INTRODUCER SHEATH TO ACCESS THE PATIENT'S TARGET LESION LOCATED IN THE SUPERFICIAL FEMORAL ARTERY (SFA). THE HCP PLACED A FILTER, OF UNKNOWN TYPE, BELOW THE TREATMENT LOCATION AND PROCEEDED TO USE A MEDTRONIC SILVER HAWK OR HAWK ONE DEVICE TO DEBULK THE SFA.

ALLEGEDLY, DURING THE TWO MINUTE INFLATION PERIOD, THE PATIENTÂ¿S BLOOD PRESSURE REPORTEDLY DROPPED BY APPROXIMATELY 30 MILLIMETER OF MERCURY. ALLEGEDLY, THE PATIENT WENT INTO BRADYCARDIA, OF WHICH THE RATE IS UNKNOWN. THE PATIENT'S HEART RATE AND BLOOD PRESSURE WERE REPORTEDLY NORMAL PRIOR TO THE LUTONIX DCB INFLATION. THE EPISODE OF BRADYCARDIA WAS REPORTEDLY \"BRIEF, APPROXIMATELY FIVE MINUTES\". THE HCP DEFLATED THE LUTONIX DCB, WHICH RESULTED IN THE PATIENT'S HEART RATE RETURNING TO NORMAL SINUS RHYTHM. IT WAS REPORTED THAT NO DISSECTION OR EXTRAVASATION WAS FOUND AFTER THE TREATMENT WITH THE LUTONIX DCB. ALLEGEDLY, THERE WAS SOME DISTAL EMBOLIZATION BELOW THE FILTER THAT WAS REMOVED WITH A PRONTO ASPIRATION DEVICE.

THE PATIENT WAS HAVING AN ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (AMI) WITH RIGHT VENTRICULAR FAILURE. THE PHYSICIAN SCHEDULED THE PATIENT FOR AN IMPELLA RP PLACEMENT PROCEDURE. THE PATIENT WAS BROUGHT TO THE CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION LAB ON (B)(6) 2017 WHERE THE IMPELLA RP WAS PLACED VIA THE RIGHT FEMORAL ARTERY (RFA) USING A SWAN CATHETER, AND THEN EXCHANGED THE SWAN FOR AN .027 WIRE DEEP INTO THE LEFT PULMONARY ARTERY. THE PUMP WAS TRACKED OVER WIRE AND FLOWS REACHED 4.2 LPM; HOWEVER UPON WATCHING THE PATIENT UNDER FLUOROSCOPE IN THE ANTEROPOSTERIOR (AP) VIEW, THE DEVICE PLACEMENT WAS IN QUESTION. A RIGHT ANTERIOR OBLIQUE, RADIOGRAPHIC PROJECTION WAS DONE, WHICH REVEALED THAT THE POSTERIOR ANTERIOR VIEW WAS DUE TO THE PATIENT'S ANATOMY, AND NOT BECAUSE THE DEVICE WAS MAL-POSITIONED. THE PHYSICIAN THEN ATTEMPTED TO PLACE THE DEVICE AGAIN BUT A SECOND AP VIEW REVEALED THE SAME ISSUE. IT WAS THEN DECIDED TO LEAVE THE DEVICE IN THE PATIENT AND REMOVE THE PEEL-WAY SHEATH. THE PEEL-WAY OF THE SHEATH WENT VERY WELL UNTIL THE MATTRESS SUTURE WAS DEPLOYED. A NURSE HELD THE HELD MANUAL PRESSURE FOR 10 MINUTES, BUT NOTED GUSHING OF BLOOD AS THE MATTRESS SUTURES WERE NOT SUPPORTING HEMOSTASIS. THE PATIENT WAS REPORTED TO HAVE LOST APPROXIMATELY 2 ML OF BLOOD DURING THIS EVENT, AND AN UNKNOWN AMOUNT OF REPLACEMENT BLOOD PRODUCTS WERE ADMINISTERED TO THE PATIENT. ANOTHER PHYSICIAN ATTEMPTED TO PLACE MULTIPLE SUTURES WITH DEEP TISSUE BITES, BUT THE PATIENT'S GIRTH AND SIZE PRECLUDED ALL ATTEMPTS TO CONTROL THE BLEEDING. AT THIS POINT THE REPOSITIONING SHEATH HAD BEEN MANIPULATED BY THE SUTURING ATTEMPTS AND WAS PULLED BACK. THE FIRST PHYSICIAN THEN ATTEMPTED TO REPOSITION THE PUMP IN THE PA BUT WAS UNSUCCESSFUL, AND THE DEVICE HINGED IN THE RIGHT ATRIUM AND CAME OUT OF THE PA. WITHOUT SHEATH ACCESS AND THE WIRE THE DOCTOR WAS UNABLE TO REPOSITION THE DEVICE. THE IMPELLA RP WAS REMOVED FROM THE PATIENT AND A .035 STIFF WIRE WAS FROM ANOTHER IMPELLA RP KIT WAS USED TO RETAIN ACCESS FOR NEW SHEATH PLACEMENT. THIS WAS DONE BY PLACING THE WIRE THROUGH THE INLET CAGE AND REMOVING DEVICE OVER THE WIRE. A NEW 23FR PEEL-AWAY SHEATH WAS PLACED IN THE RIGHT FEMORAL ARTERY, AND ANOTHER IMPELLA RP WAS PLACED IN THE PATIENT. THE REPLACEMENT DEVICE SUCCESSFULLY SUPPORTED THE PATIENT FOR 57.62 HOURS, BUT THE PATIENT WAS REPORTED TO HAVE EXPIRED ON (B)(6) 2017."
