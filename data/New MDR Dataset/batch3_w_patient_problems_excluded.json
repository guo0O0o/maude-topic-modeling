   "TEXT": "I AM (B)(6) AND HAVE AN AGGRESSIVE FORM OF DEGENERATIVE DISC DISEASE. IN 2003, MY FIRST DISC SHATTERED INTO 22 PIECES (L3/4) WITHOUT A MAJOR INCIDENT OCCURRING. I MANAGED TO CONTROL MY PAIN THRU MEDICATION, INJECTIONS, AND PILATES. IN 2009 MY SECOND DISC (L4/5) SHATTERED AND THE INJECTIONS STOPPED WORKING AND I WAS IN SUCH PAIN THAT I EITHER NEEDED A MIRACLE OR I WAS GOING TO COMMIT SUICIDE. MY NEUROSURGEON DIDN'T WANT TO FUSE ME BECAUSE OF MY YOUNG AGE AND RAPID DISEASE. BUT, HE REFUSED TO USE THE CHARITE BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEMS IT HAD, SO I DID SOME RESEARCH AND FOUND OUT ABOUT THE M6 DISC MADE BY SPINAL KINETICS. SINCE THE FDA HAD NOT APPROVED OF IT YET, I FOUND THE DOCTOR IN (B)(6) THAT HELPED CREATE THE M6 AND WHO WAS RENOWNED FOR HIS SUCCESSFUL SURGERIES. AFTER A TON OF RESEARCH AND APPROVAL FROM MY AMERICAN DOCTORS, I CHOSE TO TRAVEL TO (B)(6) FOR THE SURGERY. ON (B)(6) 2010 I HAD TWO LUMBER M6 DISCS IMPLANTED INTO MY L3/4 AND L4/5. THE SURGERY SAVED MY LIFE AND TOOK ALL THE PAIN AWAY! UNFORTUNATELY, 8 MONTHS LATER, I HAD BILATERAL PSOAS ABSCESSES WHICH RESULTED IN DRAINS ON BOTH HIPS FOR 2 1/2 YEARS, A PIC LINE WITH BOTH DAPTOMYCIN AND VANCOMYCIN FOR 6 MONTHS, HOSPITALIZATION FOR 3 WEEKS BECAUSE DOCTORS COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON AND I WAS ON MY DEATH BED. FOR THE PAST 3 YEARS, I HAVE HAD EITHER DRAINS IN MY SIDES OR OPEN WOUNDS WHICH ONE SIDE HEMORRHAGES ONCE A DAY AND THE OTHER SIDE SEEPS OUT A PUSS LIKE SUBSTANCE. I'M IN CONSTANT PAIN NOT FROM MY BACK WHICH, IS DOING GREAT, BUT FROM MY SIDES! A MONTH AGO, I WENT TO A HOLISTIC DOCTOR WHO WAS THE ONLY ONE TO FIGURE OUT THAT I AM ALLERGIC TO TITANIUM, SILICON, AND CEMENT, ALL OF WHICH COMPOSE THE M6. MY BODY HAD HAD A SEVERE ALLERGIC REACTION TO MY DISCS. NO ONE THOUGHT TO TEST ME FOR METAL OR SILICON ALLERGIES BEFORE MY SURGERY. AND SPINAL KINETICS REFUSES TO RETURN MY CALLS AND EMAILS PLUS THERE IS NOTHING ON THEIR WEBSITE DETAILING WHAT THE M6 DISC IS MADE OF. I HAD TO FIND OUT DIGGING DEEP INTO YOUR TRAILS AND A (B)(6) DOCTOR'S WEBSITE. I'M IN THE PROCESS OF TAKING TWO ANTIDOTES TO TRY AND REVERSE THE ALLERGIC REACTION BECAUSE, IF I HAVE TO HAVE THE DISCS REMOVED, I HAVE LITTLE TO NO OPTIONS TO REPLACE THEM WITH AND WILL MORE THAN LIKELY BE FORCED INTO A WHEELCHAIR UNTIL MEDICINE TECHNOLOGY CAN COME UP WITH A NON-TITANIUM BASED DISC. I'M NOT EVEN (B)(6) AND THIS HAS ENDED MY 25 PLUS YEAR CAREER AND FORCED ME TO BE HOUSE BOUND MOST OF THE TIME. MY LIFE HAS BEEN REDUCED TO DEALING WITH LOSING BLOOD DAILY, HAVING TO GET MULTIPLE IRON INFUSIONS, BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS, AND NO SOCIAL LIFE. I USED TO RIDE HORSES, SWIM AT THE LAKE AND BEACH, TRAVEL THE WORLD, AND ENJOY MY LIFE. NOW, I TAKE MEDICATION, CHANGE BANDAGES, HEMORRHAGE DAILY AND REST ON THE COUCH. THANKS TO THE PAIN FROM BEFORE MY SURGERY AND THE PAIN AFTERWARDS, I BECAME TOO DEPEND ON HIGH POWERED MEDICATION WHICH FORCED ME TO NEED TO GO TO REHAB FOR 30 DAYS. BEFORE (B)(6), I HAVE NO INSURANCE SO, ALL IN ALL, I HAVE SPENT OVER (B)(6) TRYING TO SAVE MY LIFE."

MEDTRONIC LITERATURE REVIEW FOUND A REPORT OF BACTERIAL INFECTION AFTER ONYX EMBOLIZATION. THE PATIENT HAD A LEFT POSTERIOR TEMPORAL-OCCIPITAL ARTERIOVENOUS MALFORMATION (AVM) NIDUS MEASURING 3.0 X 2.0 X 2.1 CM SUPPLIED BY THE POSTERIOR TEMPORAL BRANCH OF THE LEFT POSTERIOR CEREBRAL ARTERY AND THREE SMALL ARTERIAL FEEDERS ARISING FROM THE POSTERIOR TEMPORAL BRANCH OF THE LEFT MIDDLE CEREBRAL ARTERY. THE PATIENT UNDERWENT TWO STAGE ENDOVASCULAR EMBOLIZATION WITH ONYX 18 OVER A PERIOD OF 4 DAYS. DURING THE FIRST SESSION, THE ARTERIAL SUPPLY FROM THE LEFT POSTERIOR CEREBRAL ARTERY WAS EMBOLIZED, AND DURING THE SECOND SESSION, SUPPLY FROM THE LEFT MIDDLE CEREBRAL ARTERY WAS EMBOLIZED. AFTER THE SECOND SESSION, APPROXIMATELY 30% OF THE AVM NIDUS REMAINED. BOTH EMBOLIZATION PROCEDURES PROCEEDED WITHOUT IMMEDIATE COMPLICATIONS AND THE PATIENT RECOVERED IN THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT FOR PLANNED SURGICAL RESECTION OF THE RESIDUAL NIDUS. TWO DAYS POST-PROCEDURE, THE PATIENT DEVELOPED ESCHERICHIA COLI BACTEREMIA AND WORSENING LIVER FAILURE (THE PATIENT HAD A HISTORY OF ALCOHOLIC CIRRHOSIS) DUE TO PORTAL VEIN THROMBOSIS. SURGERY WAS CANCELLED AND HE WAS STARTED ON MEROPENEM AND DISCHARGED TO A REHAB ILITATION FACILITY. FIVE WEEKS LATER THE PATIENT RETURNED TO THE HOSPITAL WITH NEW RIGHT-SIDED WEAKNESS, APHASIA AND FEVER. BLOOD CULTURES WERE POSITIVE FOR E. COLI ON ADMISSION. MRI REVEALED A RING-ENHANCING LESION ADJACENT TO THE ONYX CAST WITH WORSENING VASOGENIC EDEMA CONCERNING FOR A CEREBRAL ABSCESS. AFTER CORRECTING HIS COAGULOPATHY DUE TO CIRRHOSIS, THE PATIENT WAS TAKEN TO THE OPERATING ROOM FOR A LEFT POSTERIOR TEMPORAL CRANIOTOMY FOR EVACUATION OF HIS CEREBRAL ABSCESS AND RESECTION OF THE RESIDUAL AVM ALONG WITH THE ONYX MATERIAL. CULTURES FROM THE OPERATING ROOM WERE POSITIVE FOR E. COLI AND THE PATIENT WAS CONTINUED ON MEROPENEM. THE PATIENT WAS DISCHARGED TO AN ACUTE REHABILITATION FACILITY TWO WEEKS AFTER THE OPERATION. AFTER A 6-WEEK COURSE OF MEROPENEM HIS NEUROLOGICAL SYMPTOMS HAD COMPLETELY RESOLVED."

SUBSEQUENTLY, PATH REPORTS CONFIRMED PRE-EXISTING MALIGNANT MELANOMA PRIOR TO THE INITIAL APLIGRAF APPLICATION. THE PT SUSTAINED THE ORIGINAL INJURY IN (B)(6) 2011 AFTER STEPPING ON A PIECE OF TINTED GLASS FROM A BROKEN PLATE. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE PT WAITED TWO (2) WEEKS PRIOR TO SEEKING MEDICAL CARE. ON (B)(6) 2011, DR. (B)(6) SURGICALLY REMOVED THE HYPERKERATOTIC TISSUE UNDER FLUOROSCOPY WITHOUT COMPLICATION. THE EXCISED MASS OF APPROXIMATE SIZE 2.5 CM X 1.0 CM X 1.0 CM WAS SUBMITTED TO PATHOLOGY FOR EVAL. PRIOR TO TREATMENT WITH APLIGRAF THE SURGICAL DRESSING CONSISTED OF ADAPTIC, WET TO DRY AND WAS LEFT INTACT UNTIL F/U VISIT ON (B)(6) 2011. APLIGRAF TREATMENT DATES ARE AS FOLLOWS: TREATMENT ON (B)(6) 2011 LOT GS1108.16.01.1A UNIT 183; EXP DATE SEPTEMBER 22, 2011. TREATMENT ON (B)(6) 2011 LOT GS1108.23.03.1A UNIT 137; EXP DATE SEPTEMBER 30, 2011. TREATMENT ON (B)(6) 2011, LOT GS1109.13.02.2A UNIT 8; EXP DATE OCTOBER 18, 2011. THE APLIGRAF UNIT APPLIED ON (B)(6) 2011 WAS WITHIN THE REQUIRED NORMAL PH RANGE PRIOR TO APPLICATION. THE UNIT WAS TEASED AWAY FROM THE SIDE OF THE TRANSWELL WITH COTTON TIPPED APPLICATORS. WOUND BED PREPARATION CONSISTED OF DEBRIDEMENT AND IRRIGATION WITH COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF NORMAL SALINE. THE APLIGRAF WAS APPLIED TO THE WOUND USING FORCEPS. THE WOUND WAS COVERED WITH A MEPITEL DRESSING, HYDROGEL, GAUZE, AND ACE WRAP. THE PT WAS INSTRUCTED TO RETURN TO THE CLINIC FOR WEEKLY DRESSING CHANGES. THE PT WAS SEEN BY DR. (B)(6) ON (B)(6) 2012 AT WHICH TIME HE WAS OBSERVED TO HAVE A CIRCULAR, SYMMETRICAL, ECCHYMOTIC \"PURPLISH\" LESION ABOUT 2.5 CM IN DIAMETER ON THE LEFT HEEL. ON (B)(6) 2012 THE LESION WAS OBSERVED TO BE ASYMMETRICAL. X-RAYS WERE NEGATIVE FOR A FOREIGN BODY AT THAT TIME. ULTRASOUND RESULTS SHOWED A SMALL ABSCESS OF APPROX 2.0 CM IN DIAMETER. CT SCAN RESULTS NOTED THE LEFT HEEL TO BE EDEMATOUS WITH NO EVIDENCE OF DISCRETE FLUID OR INFLAMMATION. PUNCH BIOPSIES X2 OBTAINED ON (B)(6) 2012 WERE POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT MELANOMA. A PET SCAN ON (B)(6) 2012 WAS POSITIVE FOR HYPERTROPHIC LYMPH NODES IN THE GROIN, RETROPERITONEAL AREA AND PELVIS AND CONFIRMED THE LEFT HEEL LESION TO BE THE PRIMARY MELANOMA. THE CASE WAS PRESENTED TO THE VA TUMOR BOARD WHO RECOMMENDED REVIEW OF ORIGINAL PATH SPECIMEN. A SECOND PATHOLOGIST REVIEW OF THE ORIGINAL SPECIMEN [DATE UNK] AND THE ASSESSMENT REPORT NOTED \"SHOWS SIGNIFICANT PATHOLOGY\". AS A RESULT, THE ORIGINAL BIOPSY SPECIMEN WAS RE-EXAMINED BY AN EXTERNAL PATHOLOGIST ON (B)(6) 2012 AND IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THERE WERE IMMATURE SCATTERED CELLS CONSISTENT WITH MALIGNANT MELANOMA PRESENT PRIOR TO APLIGRAF APPLICATION."
