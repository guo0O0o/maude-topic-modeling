# MAUDE Topic Modeling

This project focuses on topic modeling on the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. 

## How to Run
The MAUDE files are given in the repo. To run, execute main.py. Running main.py will output the coherence scores for a few devices in a specific batch (batch5) which is designated as the dev/test set. The code requires the following packages in order to run.
```bash
pip install gensim pandas nltk
